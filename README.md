# [Fastnfolio]()

Welcome to the Fastn Portfolio Template repository! ðŸš€

## Introduction

This repository is part of the Fastnfolio campaign, aiming to showcase the power and flexibility of Fastn by providing you with a template to create your own interactive and engaging portfolio website. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this template offers a hands-on opportunity to explore Fastn's features and create your unique online presence.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with your own Fastn-powered portfolio:

### 1. Fork this Repository

Click the `Use This Template` button at the right corner of this repository to create your own copy. This will allow you to make changes without affecting the original template.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.   
Replace `repo-name` with your GitHub Repo name.   

### 3. Customize Your Portfolio

1. Open `index.ftd`.

2. Replace variables in the `lib.page` and `lib.header` sections:
   - Update `logo`, `logo-text`, `cta-text-*`, and `cta-text-*_url` as needed.

3. Customize the `hero.hero-1` section:
   - Modify `hero-1`, `cta-button-*`, `link-*`, and `cover` based on your details.

4. Edit the paragraph below `hero.hero-1` to describe yourself.


**You can also customize your individual portfolio in two ways:**

- **Using Pre-Built Components:** Explore the FastnUI library and call pre-built existing components. Edit and style them to match your preferences. [FastnUI](https://fastnui.trizwit.com/)

- **Creating Custom Components:** If you're feeling creative, design your own custom components using the Fastn language. [Fastn Language Guide](https://fastn.com/components/), [Video Guide](https://youtu.be/DkZEuC0a-Pk)
